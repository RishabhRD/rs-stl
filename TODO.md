# Future tasks to plan

## Split algorithm

If split algorithm should return Array<Slices> or it should return Iterator<Slices>.

## Solutioning for solving ReversedCollection

Maybe we need to do:

- Add RevIter
- MutableBidirectionalCollection
- MutableRandomAccessCollection
- LazyBidirectionalCollection
- LazyRandomAccessCollection
