# rs-stl Goals

## Non Measurable Goals

- Implement as many algorithms as possible
- Implement as many views as possible.

## Measurable Goals

### Support for standard library

- [x] Support for `str`.
- [ ] Support for `Map` or provide new `Map`.
- [ ] Support for `HashMap` or provide new `HashMap`.

## Open Questions

- Should `actions` be supported? See `range-v3` actions to know more about it.

## Desirable
- 100% test coverage? I don't like to chase test converage, but with algorithmic
  library its achievable.
